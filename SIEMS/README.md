# Simple SIEM   
(System Information and Event Management)

## Wazuh (Open-Source XDR and SIEM)   
A program or better yet a SIEM platform solution im currently working in.   
I'm trying to learn the tool and have already identified some areas in need of improvement.
The goal while implementing wazuh is to comprehend the tool better and it's features.   
By adding applications such as sysmon and winlogbeat on a Windows10 client    
you can control pretty much anything that should monitored.   

## ELKstack
ELKstack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana).   
While I'm for the moment not investing to much time into logstash I'm utilizing Elasticsaerch and Kibana.   
The goal is still to have logged system that I'm in control off and to learn the tools named.
